\section{Introduction}
Oliver Byrne's \href{https://archive.org/details/firstsixbooksofe00byrn/}{1847 quirky edition on the first six books of Euclid's ``Elements''}\cite{Byrne1847} is an interesting example of tight interplay between text and graphics in information visualization. The main feature of this book is that instead of relying on letter designations to describe lines, angles, etc., all the diagrams in it are colored and parts of these diagrams are directly incorporated into text.

Recently this work met somewhat of a renaissance and in the span of a couple of years at least three independent attempts were made at reviving Byrne's work. In early 2017 the first six books \href{https://github.com/jemmybutton/byrne-euclid/}{remade in \ConTeXt} were published on GitHub\cite{Slyusarev2017}, in late 2018 an \href{https://www.c82.net/euclid/}{interactive web-version} was published by Nicholas Rougeux\cite{Rougeux2018} and in late 2019 a \href{https://www.kroneckerwallis.com/product/euclids-elements-completing-oliver-byrnes-work/}{printed version} of all Euclid's 15 books was published by Kronecker Wallis. All three are very different in terms of approach and goals.

The \ConTeXt\ version's main objective was to develop a toolkit for applying Byrne's approach to a variety of geometry problems in the least time-consuming manner. This package is a \LaTeX\ (specifically \LuaLaTeX) version of the toolkit. It consists of two parts: \METAPOST\ code to describe and render geometric constructions and \LaTeX\ code to incorporate these constructions in text.

\section{Requirements}

This package works with \LuaLaTeX\ and requires \texttt{luamplib v2.23.0} or higher.
\section{Example}

\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
\vskip 0.5\baselineskip
\defineNewPicture{
textLabels := true;
angleSize := 1cm;
pair A, B, C;
A := (0, 0);
B := (0, 2cm);
C := (3cm, 0);
byAngleDefine(C, B, A, byyellow, 0);
byAngleDefine(B, A, C, byblue, 0);
byAngleDefine(A, C, B, byred, 0);
draw byNamedAngleResized();
byLineDefine(A, B, byred, 0, 0);    
byLineDefine(B, C, byblue, 0, 0);   
byLineDefine(C, A, byyellow, 0, 0); 
draw byNamedLineSeq(0)(AB,BC,CA);
draw byLabelsOnPolygon(A, B, C)(0, 0);
}
~\hfill\drawCurrentPicture\hfill~
\vskip \baselineskip

In 
\drawFromCurrentPicture[middle][triangleABC]{
startAutoLabeling;
draw byNamedLineSeq(0)(AB,BC,CA);
stopAutoLabeling;
} 
the angle \drawAngle{A} 
is a right angle, therefore \triangleABC 
is a right-angled triangle. 
In it $\drawUnitLine{CB} > \drawUnitLine{AB}$ 
and $\drawUnitLine{BC} > \drawUnitLine{AC}$.
\end{minipage}

\vskip 2\baselineskip
The construction above is described like this:
\vskip 1.5\baselineskip

\begin{lstlisting}
\usepackage{byrne}
...
\defineNewPicture{ % MetaPost code to describe the main diagram is placed inside
  textLabels := true; % This turns text labels on
  pair A, B, C; 
  A := (0, 0);  
  B := (0, 2cm);
  C := (3cm, 0);
  byAngleDefine(C, B, A, byyellow, 0); % This defines a yellow angle CBA
  byAngleDefine(B, A, C, byblue, 0);   
  byAngleDefine(A, C, B, byred, 0);    
  draw byNamedAngleResized(); % Draws angles. 
  byLineDefine(A, B, byred, 0, 0);    % This defines a red line AB. 
  byLineDefine(B, C, byblue, 0, 0);   
  byLineDefine(C, A, byyellow, 0, 0); 
  draw byNamedLineSeq(1)(AB,BC,CA); % Draws joint lines in sequence
  draw byLabelsOnPolygon(A, B, C)(0, 0); % Draws text labels
}                                   
\drawCurrentPicture % Draws the diagram

In 
\drawFromCurrentPicture[middle][triangleABC]{ 
  startAutoLabeling;
  draw byNamedLineSeq(0)(AB,BC,CA);           
  stopAutoLabeling;
}
the angle \drawAngle{A} is a right angle, therefore \triangleABC\ is
a right-angled triangle. In it $\drawUnitLine{CB} > \drawUnitLine{AB}$ 
and $\drawUnitLine{BC} > \drawUnitLine{AC}$. 
\end{lstlisting}

\vskip 1.5\baselineskip

Several things to note here. 

In the \METAPOST\ part: 
All points are ordinary \METAPOST\ pairs and can be defined and manipulated as such. Normally every part of the diagram is first defined (e.g. \texttt{byAngleDefine} or \texttt{byLineDefine}) and then is drawn (e.g. \texttt{draw byNamedAngleResized...} or \texttt{draw byNamedLineSeq...}). Also, although Byrne didn't use text labels in his book, they are implemented in this package \ref{textlabels}. Normally they are placed semi-manually in the main diagram (using functions like \texttt{byLabelsOnPolygon}) and mostly automatically in offspring pictures. By default they are turned off, and to turn them on \texttt{textLabels := true;} should be set.

In the \LaTeX\ part: 
The most general way to reference main diagram is to use \cs{drawFromCurrentPicture}. It will process arbitrary \METAPOST\ code based on the main diagram's code and output an image. However, it would be too cumbersome to use this route every time, so a few shortcuts are in place. If you do need to process arbitrary code, you can give picture a name (in the example it's \texttt{triangleABC}). It will define a macro of the same name \cs{triangleABC} which will output the same image again. For most common cases there are special macros which don't require you to write any \METAPOST\ code. For instance \cs{drawAngle} and \cs{drawUnitLine} allow you to call angles and lines simply by name. The names don't have to match the initial definition exactly. For instance, the angle in the example can be called \texttt{A}, \texttt{BAC} or \texttt{ABC} interchangeably, or the same line segment can be called either \texttt{BC} or \texttt{CB}.

For more examples you can look at the source code of the \href{https://github.com/jemmybutton/byrne-euclid/}{\ConTeXt\ version of Byrne's book.} This package shares syntax with it and its code can be transferred to \LaTeX\ with minimal changes.

The following reference guide is not complete and will be updated in the future.

\section{\METAPOST\ part reference}

\subsection{Global variables and settings}

\subsubsection{Global variables}\label{Variables}
	
	There are several variables which control the looks and behaviour.
	
	\texttt{lineWidth}\label{lineWidth}~— the width for regular lines, set to \texttt{2pt} by default. Normally referenced as \texttt{0}.
	
	\texttt{lineWidthThin}~— the width for thin lines, set to \texttt{1pt} by default. Normally referenced as \texttt{1}.
	
	\texttt{lineWidthHair}~— the width for superthin lines, set to \texttt{1/2pt} by default. Normally referenced as \texttt{2}.
	
	\texttt{pointMarkSize}\label{pointMarkSize}~— size of point marks, set to \texttt{4pt} by default.
	
	\texttt{pointLinesSize}\label{pointLinesSize}~— size for line segments used to depict points, set to \texttt{1/2cm} by default.

	\texttt{defaultScaleFactor}~— global default scale factor, set to \texttt{1} by default.

	\texttt{angleSize}\label{angleSize}~— angle arc radius, set to \texttt{1cm} by default.
	
	\texttt{angleScale}\label{angleScale}~— scale factor for angle arcs, set to \texttt{1} by default.

	\texttt{globalRotation}~— angle to rotate the whole picture.

	\texttt{markLength}~— size of marks on lines, set to \texttt{3lineWidth} by default.

	\texttt{rayExtension}~— length for a ray depiction, set to \texttt{1/3cm} by default.

%	magnitudeSize := 5/18cm;
%	magnitudeScale := 1;
%	magnitudeGap := 3/2lineWidth;
	
	\texttt{textLabels}~— whether to render text labels, set to \texttt{false} by default.

%ghostLines := true;

	\texttt{autoRightAngles}\label{autoRightAngles}~— whether to depict right angles using angles instead of arcs, set to \texttt{false} by default.

%omitDuplicateTextLabels := false;
	
	\texttt{textLabelShift}~— how far away to put text labels from points, set to \texttt{lineWidth} by default.
	
%autoLabelingMode := false;
%mainPictureMode := false;

%pathToString

\subsubsection{defineColor.ColorName(color)}\label{defineColor}
	
	\defineNewPicture{
	textLabels := false;
	pair A, B, C;
	A := dir(60);
	B := (0, 0);
	C := dir(0);
	forsuffixes s=byblack,byred,byblue,byyellow,oiBlack,oiOrange,oiSkyBlue,oiGreen,oiYellow,oiBlue,oiVermillion,oiPurple:
		byAngleDefine.s(A, B, C,s, 0);

	}
	Defines a color. Colors can be defined as regular \METAPOST\ colors as well, this is just a shorthand version.

	\texttt{ColorName}~— mandatory color name of \texttt{suffix type}.
	
	\texttt{color}~— an actual calor, can be either of \texttt{color} type or of \texttt{cmykcolor} type.

Colors similar to the ones Byrne used for his book are: \texttt{byblack}\drawAngle{byblack}, \texttt{byred}\drawAngle{byred}, \texttt{byblue}\drawAngle{byblue}, \texttt{byyellow}\drawAngle{byyellow}. One obvious issue of any color coding is whether the colors are discernible by colorblind people. Byrne's colors should be mostly fine, but there are only foru of them. In case more colors are necessary, eight colors from \href{https://jfly.uni-koeln.de/color/}{colorblind-friendly palette by Okabe and Ito} \cite{Okabe2008} are defined: \texttt{oiBlack}\drawAngle{oiBlack}, \texttt{oiOrange}\drawAngle{oiOrange}, \texttt{oiSkyBlue}\drawAngle{oiSkyBlue}, \texttt{oiGreen}\drawAngle{oiGreen}, \texttt{oiYellow}\drawAngle{oiYellow}, \texttt{oiBlue}\drawAngle{oiBlue}, \texttt{oiVermillion}\drawAngle{oiVermillion}, \texttt{oiPurple}\drawAngle{oiPurple}. Also text labels \ref{textlabels} are helpful as a secondary means of identification.

\subsubsection{Angle styles}\label{AngleStyles}

	It's possible to add custom angle styles. To do this, you first need to define a function, with a particular set of arguments and then include this function's name into a special list. As an example here's the function which describes a regular solid angle sector:
	
\begin{lstlisting}
vardef byAngleMSolid (expr angleArc, angleColor)(suffix AngleOptionalColors) =
    save p;
    path p;
    p := angleArc scaled (angleScale*angleSize);
    image(
        fill ((0, 0)--p--cycle) withcolor angleColor;
    )
enddef;
\end{lstlisting}

	Note the argument \texttt{AngleOptionalColors}. It is not used for solid angles and is not defined with \texttt{byAngleDefine}, but several optional colors can be defined using \texttt{byAngleDefineExtended} \ref{byAngleDefineExtended} and can be accessed using \texttt{AngleOptionalColors[0]}, \texttt{AngleOptionalColors[1]} etc.

	And here's how this angle style is included in the list:

\begin{lstlisting}
byAngleMacroName[0] := "byAngleMSolid";
\end{lstlisting}

	Here \texttt{0} is the value of \texttt{sty} argument used in \texttt{byAngleDefine} \ref{byAngleDefine} and such to call this particular angle style.
	
	As a more practical example, in Byrne's book, in a couple of places for some reason he chooses not to use ordinary arcs and sectors, but instead goes with unique angle designs. In order not to include these peculiarities into the main lib in the \ConTeXt\ version they were defined \textit{in situ}. Here's the definition from IV.III:

	\defineNewPicture{
		vardef byAngleMSectors (expr angleArc, angleColor)(suffix angleOptionalColors) =
		    save p;
		    path p[];
		    p1 := (subpath(0, arctime (1/3arclength(angleArc)) of angleArc) 
		    	of angleArc) 
		    	scaled (angleScale*angleSize);
		    p2 := (subpath(arctime (1/3arclength(angleArc)) 
		    	of angleArc, arctime(2/3arclength(angleArc)) of angleArc) of angleArc) 
		    	scaled (angleScale*angleSize);
		    p3 := (subpath(arctime (2/3arclength(angleArc)) 
		    	of angleArc, length(angleArc)) of angleArc) 
		    	scaled (angleScale*angleSize);
		    image(
		        fill ((0, 0)--p1--cycle) withcolor angleOptionalColors[0];
		        fill ((0, 0)--p2--cycle) withcolor angleColor;
		        fill ((0, 0)--p3--cycle) withcolor angleOptionalColors[1];
		    )
		enddef;
		byAngleMacroName[3] := "byAngleMSectors";
		textLabels := false;
		pair A, B, C;
		A :=  dir(45) scaled 1/4cm;
		B := (0, 0);
		C :=  dir(0) scaled 1/4cm;
		byAngleDefineExtended(A, B, C, byred, 3)(byblue, byyellow);
	}
	
\begin{lstlisting}	
vardef byAngleMSectors (expr angleArc, angleColor)(suffix angleOptionalColors) =
    save p;
    path p[];
    p1 := (subpath(0, arctime (1/3arclength(angleArc)) of angleArc) 
    	of angleArc) 
    	scaled (angleScale*angleSize);
    p2 := (subpath(arctime (1/3arclength(angleArc)) 
    	of angleArc, arctime(2/3arclength(angleArc)) of angleArc) of angleArc) 
    	scaled (angleScale*angleSize);
    p3 := (subpath(arctime (2/3arclength(angleArc)) 
    	of angleArc, length(angleArc)) of angleArc) 
    	scaled (angleScale*angleSize);
    image(
        fill ((0, 0)--p1--cycle) withcolor angleOptionalColors[0];
        fill ((0, 0)--p2--cycle) withcolor angleColor;
        fill ((0, 0)--p3--cycle) withcolor angleOptionalColors[1];
    )
enddef;
byAngleMacroName[3] := "byAngleMSectors";
\end{lstlisting}

This angle style employs two optional colors and can be called by setting \texttt{style} argument \ref{byAngleDefine} to \texttt{3}. This is what the result of \texttt{byAngleDefineExtended(A, B, C, byred, 3)(byblue, byyellow);} (\ref{byAngleDefineExtended}) looks like:\drawAngle{B}.

\subsection{Text labels}\label{textlabels}

There are no text labels in Byrne's book, but, as Edward Tufte points out in his 1990 book, adding small text labels can actually help speed recognition of geometric elements \cite{Tufte90}. It's not clear whether it's indeed the case for the reader, but at the very least text labels provide the author with the means of linking source code with the rendered pages. Several functions listed below allow for adding text labels very similar to the ones suggested by Tufte.

Text labels are turned off by default. As a result, simply adding code for text labels won't make them visible. They only appear when \texttt{textLabels := true;} is set in the beginning of a main picture or globally by defining \texttt{\textbackslash def\textbackslash\{...\} mpPre} \ref{defineNewPicture}. Text labels don't always have to be added manually, most elements can do auto labeling \ref{startAutoLabeling} which is intended to work with standalone angles, polygons, etc.

	}, \texttt{3} omits the first point

	draw byLabelsOnPolygon(A, B, C, D)(4, 0);
	}.

	\defineNewPicture{textLabels := false;}
	Draws a right angle \drawRightAngle\ and two right angles \drawTwoRightAngles\ respectively.

	If you choose to go with angles instead of arcs for right angles (\ref{autoRightAngles}, \ref{byConsiderAngleRight}), adding \texttt{autoRightAngles := true;} to \texttt{\textbackslash mpPre} \ref{defineNewPicture} won't change the appearance of these angles, since they are defined before \texttt{\textbackslash mpPre} commands are executed. Instead, these angles should be redefined. There's a special command for this purpose: \texttt{byDefineGenericRightAngles(true);} where \texttt{true} tells this command to run \texttt{byConsiderAngleRight} \ref{byConsiderAngleRight} for each of the generic right angles.

	When just one letter is used, all the angles defined at this point will be drawn, e.g. \drawAngle{O}. When used to reference one single defined angle, the direction doesn't matter. 
	E.g. \texttt{AOB} and \texttt{BOA} will return the same picture \drawAngle{AOB}. 
	When used to reference an angle composed of several defined angles, the name sould be given counterclockwise. 
	E.g. \texttt{\textbackslash drawAngle\{AOD\}} is \drawAngle{AOD} and \texttt{\textbackslash drawAngle\{DOA\}} is \drawAngle{DOA}.

\subsubsection{\textbackslash drawArc[verticalAlignment][scaleFactor]\{ArcName\}}

	Draws an arc.

	\texttt{verticalAlignment}~— optional vertical alignment declaration. \texttt{middle} to align the picture with the middle of the line, anything else for bottom alignment.
	
	\texttt{scaleFactor}~— optional scale factor for the arc to replace the default offspring picture scale factor. 
	
	\texttt{ArcName}~— name of the arc to reference in the main diagram. 
	
	Can be called later using \texttt{\textbackslash arcCircleName}.
	
\subsubsection{\textbackslash drawLine[verticalAlignment][LineNewName]\{LineName\}}

	Draws a line.

	\texttt{verticalAlignment}~— optional vertical alignment declaration. \texttt{middle} to align the picture with the middle of the line, anything else for bottom alignment.
	
	\texttt{LineNewName}~— optional line name. 
	
	\texttt{LineName}~— name of the line to reference in the main diagram. 
	
	If a name is given, can be called later using \texttt{\textbackslash LineNewName}, otherwise~— \texttt{\textbackslash lineLineName}. 
	
\subsubsection{\textbackslash drawPointM\{PointName\}}

	\defineNewPicture{
	pair A, B, C, D;
	A := (0, 0);
	B := dir(15)*cm;
	C := B rotated 120;
	D := C rotated 120;
	byLineDefine(A, B, byred, 0, 0);
	byLineDefine(A, C, byyellow, 0, 0);
	byLineDefine(A, D, byblue, 0, 0);
	draw byNamedLine(AD);
	draw byNamedLineSeq(0)(AB,AC);
	draw byPointMark(A,  byblack, 1);
	}	

	Draws a point, depicted as a small circle \drawPointM{A}.
	
	\texttt{PointName}~— name of the point to reference in the main diagram. 
	
	Can be called later using \texttt{\textbackslash pointmPointName}. 

\subsubsection{\textbackslash drawPointL[verticalAlignment][LinesToOmit]\{PointName\}}\label{drawPointL}

	Draws a point, depicted as line segments starting/ending in it \drawPointL{A}. Only the lines which were actually drawn, not just defined, are used. Line segments' length is controlled by \texttt{pointLinesSize} \ref{pointLinesSize}.

	\texttt{verticalAlignment}~— optional vertical alignment declaration. \texttt{middle} to align the picture with the middle of the line, anything else for bottom alignment.
	
	\texttt{LinesToOmit}~— a comma-separated list lines, segments of which not to draw. 
	
	\texttt{PointName}~— name of the point to reference in the main diagram. 
	
	If a list of lines to omit is given, can be called later using \texttt{\textbackslash pointl\-Point\-Name\-Minus\-Lines\-To\-Omit}, otherwise~— \texttt{\textbackslash pointlPointName}. 

\subsubsection{\textbackslash drawPoint[verticalAlignment][LinesToOmit]\{PointName\}}

	Draws a point, depicted as line segments starting/ending in it with a point mark if defined \drawPoint{A}. Only the lines which were actually drawn, not just defined, are used.

	Arguments are the same as in \texttt{drawPointL} \ref{drawPointL}.
	
	If a list of lines to omit is given, can be called later using \texttt{\textbackslash point\-Point\-Name\-Minus\-Lines\-To\-Omit}, otherwise~— \texttt{\textbackslash pointPointName}.
