LaTeX and MetaPost package for making geometry diagrams in the style
of [Oliver Byrne's "The first six books of the Elements of Euclid"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Byrne_(mathematician)#Byrne.27s_Euclid)

![title](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/729314c5-0417-4c0f-bdfd-e222a738db33)

Byrne's book in full made using this package can be found [here](https://github.com/jemmybutton/byrne-euclid/).

It was tested and works with TeX Live 2021, but should work with earlier versions,
except for it requires [luamplib v2.23.0](https://github.com/lualatex/luamplib/releases/tag/v2.23.0)
